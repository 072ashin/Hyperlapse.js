[Simple example (CN Tower).](http://)

This library was written to create dynamic hyper-lapse (time-lapse with movement) sequences using Google Street View. It is WebGL based that has dependances with [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) (r57), a modified version of [GSVPano.js](https://github.com/pnitsch/GSVPano.js), and [Google Maps API v3](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/3.exp/reference).
